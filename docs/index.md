# Symergetics Package Documentation

## Overview

The **Symergetics** package is a comprehensive implementation of Buckminster Fuller's mathematical and geometric concepts, providing exact rational arithmetic for synergetic calculations.

### Core Concept: Symbolic Operations on All-Integer Accounting

At its foundation, Synergetics implements **symbolic operations on all-integer accounting based upon ratios (geometrically based upon high frequency shapes) of the Synergetics geometry and Quadray/4D coordinates**. This approach provides:

- **Symbolic Operations**: Exact mathematical manipulations without floating-point approximations
- **All-Integer Accounting**: Rational relationships expressed as integer ratios
- **Geometric Ratios**: Proportions derived from high-frequency polyhedral shapes
- **Synergetics Geometry**: Fuller's comprehensive geometric framework
- **Quadray/4D Coordinates**: Tetrahedral coordinate system for spatial relationships

## Key Features

- **Exact Rational Arithmetic**: Zero floating-point errors in geometric calculations
- **Quadray Coordinate System**: Integer-based tetrahedral coordinates with IVM normalization
- **Polyhedral Geometry**: Volume calculations for Platonic solids in IVM units
- **Scheherazade Mathematics**: Powers of 1001 with SSRCD pattern analysis
- **Primorial Calculations**: n# = product of primes ≤ n
- **Mnemonic Encoding**: Memory aids for large numbers

Notes:

- Default number formatting is ungrouped for symbolic workflows; use `format_large_number()` and `ungroup_number()` to transform as needed.

## Quick Start

```python
from symergetics import *

# Exact rational arithmetic
a = SymergeticsNumber(3, 4)  # 3/4
b = SymergeticsNumber(1, 2)  # 1/2
result = a + b  # = 5/4 exactly

# Quadray coordinates
coord = QuadrayCoordinate(2, 1, 1, 0)
xyz = coord.to_xyz()  # Convert to Cartesian

# Polyhedral geometry
tetra = Tetrahedron()
volume = tetra.volume()  # = 1 IVM unit

# Scheherazade mathematics
scheherazade_6 = scheherazade_power(6)  # Contains Pascal's triangle
```

### Orchestrated run (recommended)

```bash
python3 run.py                # setup (uv), tests, and examples
python3 run.py --examples-only
python3 run.py --skip-setup --skip-tests
```

- Generates organized outputs under `output/` (ASCII and PNG when configured)
- Produces a summary report and `output/orchestration_results.json`
